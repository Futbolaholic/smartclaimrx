follow-ups, healthcare providers can correct and resubmit any denials or rejections 
promptly. This proactive approach helps prevent potential revenue loss due to over-
looked claims[28][8].
Utilize a Decision Tree Approach
Implementing a decision tree can be beneficial for both staff training and deci-
sion-making. This method encourages comprehensive consideration of all possible 
outcomes and helps trace each path to a conclusion. By visualizing the appeals 
process, staff can more effectively address denials and understand the reasoning 
behind them[28][8].
Provide Comprehensive Documentation
When filing an appeal, it is critical to submit thorough documentation that sup-
ports the claim. This may include medical records, articles, images, and letters 
from providers that articulate the medical necessity of the requested treatment. 
Comprehensive documentation tailored to the insurance company's requirements 
significantly strengthens the appeal [34][14][2].
Seek Support from Providers
In many cases, the involvement of the healthcare provider can bolster the appeal 
process. A well-documented letter from the physician explaining the necessity of the 
treatment or service can enhance the appeal's chances of success. Collaboration

with providers to gather additional supportive documentation is essential, particularly 
if an initial appeal is denied [34][14].
Analyze Denial Patterns
Continuously evaluating internal workflows is crucial to identifying areas for improve-
ment. Conducting regular training sessions ensures that all staff members are up 
to date on the latest procedures and can effectively manage claims. Additionally, 
running reports to detect denial patterns enables proactive measures to prevent 
future claims from being denied, with time frames for preventive action sometimes 
as short as 90 days [14][35].
By employing these best practices, independent pharmacies can navigate the ap-
peals process more effectively, increasing the likelihood of overturning denied claims 
and ensuring that patients receive the coverage they need.
