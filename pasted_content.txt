SmartClaimRx ‚Äì Strategic Analysis & MVP Generation Prompt (Final)

üìç Context & Goal
I‚Äôm building SmartClaimRx, an AI-powered platform that helps independent pharmacies validate insurance claims, manage reimbursement issues, reduce appeal denials, etc...

My goal is to define the highest-impact MVP, outline a launch strategy, and generate a starter codebase, all grounded in the two attached research reports from Standford's Ai STORM  (on insurance denials and reimbursement challenges).

I do not know how to code, so this must be built with no-code or low-code tools where possible, or clean full-code with a simple, professional UI.

üìå Section 1 ‚Äì Strategic Analysis (Do This First)

What is the #1 MVP Pain Point we should solve first? (Quantify it if possible)

What are the top ~3 MVP Features that directly solve this pain point?

Describe the Ideal Early Adopter Profile (pharmacy type, region, size, etc.)

How does AI/autonomous agents make this product different from existing tools?

What are the key adoption risks, and how do we mitigate them?

What is the primary KPI to measure MVP success?

Synthesize the market urgency and opportunity (as in why now, why AI).

‚úÖ Complete this section fully before moving to Section 2.

üõ†Ô∏è Section 2 ‚Äì MVP Codebase 
IF Section 1 is fully complete, generate the initial MVP codebase structure using:

Tech Stack: Next.js + React + Tailwind CSS

Structure to include:

A clean dashboard UI showing the KPI from Section 1 and a table of claims

A simple claim submission + appeal generation flow

Basic routing between dashboard and form view

Mock/static data is fine (CSV or static JSON)

Placeholder service files:

claimsIntakeService.ts

denialReasonClassifier.ts

reimbursementTracker.ts

üì¶ Section 3 ‚Äì Output Format
Separate output into:

1. Strategic MVP Analysis (answers from Section 1)
2. Initial Codebase Structure (code explanation)

Constraints:

No external APIs

Focus on modular structure, file clarity, polished UI, mock data

Show key logic placeholders even if unimplemented
