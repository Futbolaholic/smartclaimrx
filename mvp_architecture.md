## Technical Implementation Approach

For the MVP, we'll implement a simplified version of the architecture focusing on the core user flows:

1. **Phase 1: UI Framework and Navigation**
   - Set up Next.js project with Tailwind CSS
   - Implement responsive layout and navigation
   - Create authentication screens (simplified for MVP)

2. **Phase 2: Dashboard and Claims List**
   - Implement dashboard with mock data
   - Create claims list view with filtering/sorting
   - Add claim detail view

3. **Phase 3: Claim Submission and Validation**
   - Build claim submission form with validation
   - Implement pre-submission check logic
   - Create submission confirmation flow

4. **Phase 4: Denial Management and Appeals**
   - Develop denial tracking interface
   - Implement appeal generation workflow
   - Create documentation management system

5. **Phase 5: Analytics and Reporting**
   - Build basic analytics dashboard
   - Implement key performance indicators
   - Create exportable reports

## Mock Data Strategy

For the MVP, we'll create realistic mock data sets:

1. **Sample Pharmacies**: 3-5 fictional independent pharmacies
2. **Sample Patients**: 20-30 fictional patients with varied insurance plans
3. **Sample Claims**: 100-200 claims with various statuses and denial reasons
4. **Sample Insurers**: 5-10 fictional insurance companies with different policies
5. **Denial Reasons**: 15-20 common denial reasons with recommended actions
6. **Appeal Templates**: 5-10 templates for different denial types

This mock data will allow for realistic demonstration of the application's capabilities without requiring integration with real pharmacy systems or insurance providers for the MVP phase.

## Future Expansion Considerations

While focusing on the core MVP features, the architecture will be designed to accommodate future expansions:

1. **Integration APIs**: Hooks for connecting to pharmacy management systems
2. **Real-time Insurance Verification**: API connections to insurance eligibility services
3. **Advanced Analytics**: Predictive modeling for denial prevention
4. **Mobile Application**: React Native extension for on-the-go access
5. **Automated Document Processing**: OCR for scanning denial letters
6. **Multi-pharmacy Management**: Features for pharmacy groups or consultants

These expansion points will be considered in the initial architecture to ensure the MVP can grow without requiring significant refactoring.
